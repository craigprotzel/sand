				<p>"Now We're Here" is an interactive audio-visual experience inspired by the texture, sound, and development of the desert terrain. This playful piece invites the user to connect with the natural environment in both a rhythmic and digital way. It also strives to be a reflection of the rapid development and urbanization occurring in the local desert terrain.</p>

				<p>This project was very much inspired by our experience living on the NYU Abu Dhabi campus - what we've seen, what we've heard, what we've felt.  We live, work, play, create in a sandbox. That sandbox is the NYU Abu Dhabi campus, Saadiyat Island, Abu Dhabi, the Emirates. Why bring the sand inside? There's no hiding from it, it's all around us.</p>

				<p>The project was initially on display at the NYU Abu Dhabi Project Gallery Space in the fall of 2015. </p>
